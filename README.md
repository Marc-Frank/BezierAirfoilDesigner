# BezierAirfoilDesigner

A tool to manipulate control points of bezier curves.
Main intended use is to generate .dat airfoil files which can be used to design subscale airplane wings.
Saving the airfoil as a .bez.dat makes handling them in CAD easier.
They also create higher quality surfaces with less computation and constraints needed.
